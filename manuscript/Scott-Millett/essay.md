# First principles of DDD: Focus, passion, collaboration, clarity and patience

* My personal context, introduction and experience of DDD in my domains, my DDD journey
* Why I am not a jedi master
* Why its hard to answer the "Can I see an example of a DDD project?" questions 

## The fundamental concepts of DDD

> Domain-driven design is both a way of thinking and a set of priorities, aimed at accelerating software projects that have to deal with complicated domains. Eric Evans, Domain-Driven Design (2003)

### Distill the Problem Domain to Reveal What Is Important

### Create models to solve problems

### Apply Bounded Contexts to Isolate Models from Ambiguity and Corruption

### Understanding the Relationships between Contexts

### Employ tactical patterns to separate technical complexity from domain logic complexity in the code model

## So what? I already knew this stuff

 * Majority of effort lies outside of the technical realm

### Software development is about people. People are complex

 *

## Keeping a focus on the goal

### Balance and Trade offs

## Learn to love your problem space

## Donâ€™t underestimate the importance of Collaboration and Facilitation

### Facilication in distillation

### Collaboration in managing dependencies of the system flow
