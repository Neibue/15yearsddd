# Domain-Driven Design as a Centered Set — Paul Rayner

*This essay has been adapted from Paul's blog post "BDD is a Centered Community," originally published in 2015.*

Dan North mentioned in the CukeUp 2015 panel the notion
of a community being a "bounded set," and I pointed out
that the same theology also talks about the notion of a community being a
"centered set." The original context of the panel discussion concerned BDD (behaviour-driven development), but I believe the idea applies equally to Domain-Driven Design (DDD). DDD is a centered set, rather than a
bounded set. To extend this further to the community that has grown around DDD over the last 15 years, we might say _DDD is a centered community, rather than a bounded community._

Let's be clear what is meant by bounded vs. centered set as it applies to a
community, and how that might apply to DDD. These terms originated in
a theological context with the writings of anthropologist and missiologist Paul
Hiebert, in terms of what makes a person a Christian. I'm going to quote and
adapt a significant amount of the content from his original article in what
follows to make it relevant for those without a background or interest in
theology.

## Bounded sets

In his 1978 article, "Conversion, Culture and Cognitive Categories", Paul Hiebert notes that many of our words refer to bounded sets:
"apples," "oranges," "pencils," and "pens," for instance. What is a bounded set?
How does our mind form it? In creating a bounded set our mind puts together
things that share some common characteristics. "Apples," for example, are objects
that are "the firm fleshy somewhat round fruit of a Rosaceous tree. They are
usually red, yellow or green and are eaten raw or cooked."

Bounded sets have certain structural characteristics — that is, they force us to
look at things in a certain way. Let us use the category "apples" to illustrate
some of these:

a. _The category is created by listing the essential characteristics that an
object must have to be within the set._ For example, an apple is (1) a kind of
"fruit" that is (2) firm, (3) fleshy, (4) somewhat round, and so on. Any fruit
that meets these requirements (assuming we have an adequate definition) is an
"apple."
b. _The category is defined by a clear boundary._ A fruit is either an apple or it
is not. It cannot be 70% apple and 30% pear. Most of the effort in defining the
category is spent on defining and maintaining the boundary. In other words, not
only must we say what an "apple" is, we must also clearly differentiate it from
"oranges," "pears," and other similar objects that are _not_ "apples."
c. _Objects within a bounded set are uniform in their essential characteristics._
All apples are 100% apple. One is not more apple than another. Either a fruit is
an apple or it is not. There may be different sizes, shapes, and varieties, but
they are all the same in that they are all apples. There is no variation
implicit within the structuring of the category.
d. _Bounded sets are static sets._ If a fruit is an apple, it remains an apple
whether it is green, ripe, or rotten. The only change occurs when an apple
ceases to be an apple (e.g., being eaten), or when something like an orange is
turned into an apple (something we cannot do). The big question, therefore, is
whether an object is inside or outside the category. Once it is within, there
can be no change in its categorical status.

## What if DDD was a Bounded Set?

What happens to our concept of "DDD" if we define it in terms of a bounded set?
If we use the above characteristics of a bounded set we probably come up with
something like the following:

a. _We would define "DDD" in terms of a set of essential or definitive
characteristics._ These characteristics, such as applying building block patterns, strategic design practices such as context mapping, or technical approaches such as event sourcing, would be non-negotiable for people doing DDD.
b. _We would make a clear distinction between what is "DDD" and what is not._
There would be no place in between. Moreover, maintaining this boundary would be critical to
the maintenance of the category of DDD. Therefore it would be essential to determine who
is doing DDD and who is not, and to keep the two sharply differentiated. We would want
to make sure to include those who
are truly doing DDD and to exclude from the community those who claim to be but are
not. If DDD was to be a bounded set, to have an unclear boundary would be to undermine the very concept of DDD
itself.
c. _We would view all "DDD practitioners" as essentially the same._ There would be
experienced DDD practitioners and beginners, but all are doing DDD, since they are
within the boundary. Homogeneity within the community in terms of belief and practices
would be the norm and the goal.

If we think of DDD as a bounded set, we must decide what are the definitive
characteristics that set a DDD practitioner apart from a non-DDD practitioner.
We might do so in terms of belief in certain essential "truths" about DDD, or
strict adherence to certain essential DDD "practices."

However, DDD as understood by leaders within the community is clearly NOT a bounded
set. Rather, it is a centered set. Let's see what we mean by that.

## Centered Sets

There are other ways to form mental categories. Hiebert says a second way is to
form centered sets. A centered set has the following characteristics:

a. _It is created by defining a center, and the relationship of things to that center._
Some things may be far from the center, but they are moving towards the
center, therefore, they are part of the centered set. On the other hand, some
objects may be near the center but are moving away from it, so they are not a
part of the set. The set is made up of all objects moving towards the center.

b. _While the centered set does not place the primary focus on the boundary,
there is a clear division between things moving in and those moving out._ An
object either belongs to a set or it does not. The set focuses upon the center
and the boundary emerges when the center and the movement of the objects has
been defined. There is no great need to maintain the boundary in order to
maintain the set. The boundary is not the focus so long as the center is clear.

c. _Centered sets reflect variation within a category._ While there is a clear
distinction between things moving in and those moving out, the objects within
the set are not categorically uniform. Some may be near the center and others
far from it, even though all are moving towards the center. Each object must be
considered individually. It is not reduced to a single common uniformity within
the category.

d. _Centered sets are dynamic sets._ Two types of movements are essential parts of
their structure. First, it is possible to change direction — to turn from moving
away to moving towards the center, from being outside to being inside the set.
Second, because all objects are seen in constant motion, they are moving, fast
or slowly, towards or away from the center. Something is always happening to an
object. It is never static.

Illustrations of centered sets are harder to come by in English, since English tends
to see the world largely in terms of bounded sets. One example is a magnetic field
in which particles are in motion. Electrons are those particles which are drawn
towards the positive magnetic pole, and protons are those attracted by the negative
pole. The diagram here is another way of visualizing a centered set

## DDD as a Centered Set

The core DDD principles have been enumerated quite clearly by Eric Evans on a number of occasions. See, for example, his Explore DDD 2018 conference keynote "DDD Isn't Done: A Skeptical, Optimistic​, Pragmatic Look".
DDD has a broad and diverse distributed community with principles at the center that endeavors to promote a growing body of knowledge conjoined with an emerging and changing cloud of practices. Focusing
on boundaries and exclusion is not what the DDD community has ever been about.

There is little interest in the DDD community in adopting a bounded set approach,
and staying static by "locking down" the body of knowledge or cloud of practices
that currently makes up DDD. Rather, the DDD community needs to
continue challenging the status quo and incorporating new learning and practices
revealed in the future. And, as Eric pointed out, even the core principles themselves should not be above challenge, or applied blindly.

In contrast to a bounded set, how might DDD be defined as a centered set?

a. _A DDD practitioner is be defined in terms of the center — in terms of the
principles, values and goals that the DDD community holds to be central_. From the
nature of the centered set, it should be clear that it is possible that there
are those near the center who know a great deal about DDD, but who are moving
away from the center. On the other hand there are those who are at a distance —
who know little about DDD because they are just starting to learn it — but they
should still be considered to be DDD practitioners.
b. _There is a clear division between being doing DDD and not doing DDD._
A boundary is present: To pick an extreme example, a team doing waterfall
(serial lifecycle phase gate) development with no collaboration between domain experts and developers, and not doing any model exploration could not be said to be doing DDD.

But with a centered set there is less stress on maintaining the
boundary in order to preserve the existence and purity of the category than with a bounded set. There is also no need to play boundary games and institutionally
exclude those who are not truly part of the DDD community. Rather, the focus is on the center
and of pointing people to that center. Inclusion, rather than exclusion, is
the name of the DDD game. At least, for a centered set that should be the goal.
c. _There is a recognition and encouragement of variation among the DDD community._ Some are
closer to DDD principles in their knowledge and practice, others have only a
little knowledge and need to grow. But - whether novice or expert or somewhere
in between - all are doing DDD, and are called to continuously seek to
improve and grow in their understanding and practice of delivering value early
and often.

Being a centered set, growth thus is an essential part of practicing DDD. When a
team begins doing DDD, they begin a journey and should strive to continue to
move towards the center. There is no static state. Learning DDD is not the end,
it is the beginning. It is not the end, it is the means to a greater end: at a minimum, creating better software to provide better outcomes for customers and stakeholders.

We need good quality DDD education, mentoring and coaching to teach
DDD to beginners who join the community in the years to come. Perhaps more importantly, we must also think about the need to continuously improve and inspire novices and practitioners alike to
move beyond the human tendency to follow recipes and so-called "best practices" and experiment with
tailoring design principles and practices to their own unique context. Also, I contend that for a healthy centered set, quality constructive disagreement should be embraced and encouraged. Dissenting ideas should be understood and evaluated to see if they have merit, rather than succumbing to the unfortunate tendency to become an echo-chamber.

I submit that the agile community in general should also be considered a
centered set, with the agile manifesto as the central value statement for the
movement. Whether DDD, or agile in general, being a centered community means seeking not only to uphold but also
increase the gravitational pull of the principles and values at the center.
