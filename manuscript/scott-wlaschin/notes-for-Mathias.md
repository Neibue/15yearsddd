Notes:

* Final draft complete. Feel free to edit.
* The file format is now UTF8/noBOM although all characters should be ASCII anyway!
* I have made this quite long! I would be happy to cut down the length by up to 50% if needed :)
* Spelling and punctuation:
  * I am using US spelling and punctuation, but I can change if needed.
  * I'm using -- for em-dashes. These are not handled in github markdown but according to LeanPub, will be converted to em-dash.
  * All smart quotes have been removed and replaced with straight (ASCII) quotes.
