# Foreword

It's rare for a software book to last fifteen years. By the time a new book gets out of beta, it's already at risk of being obsolete. Eric Evans' *"Domain-Driven Design — Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software"* (Addison-Wesley) is, over 15 years after its publication, sparking a renewed interest in software design. Books and blogs have expanded on the ideas proposed by Eric; people have created new methods to apply the principles; there are workshops and online courses; conferences in Europe, Asia, and North-America; and dozens of meetups all over the world.  

And where traditionally, the DDD community used to be exclusively populated by programmers and architects, we're now seeing growing attention from different disciplines in software design. Analysts seem to be leading the way — a natural fit, as modelling has always been a fundamental part of analysis. But now testers and product designers are discovering the value of Domain-Driven Design. They too deal in models, and are attracted to the principles and methods of building and collaborating on models, of sharing a Ubiquitous Language, and of finding better context boundaries for managing the growing complexity of software.

What makes the success of DDD even more surprising, is that Eric's book has a reputation of being theoretical, academic, or philosophical; terms used by programmers when they simply mean "hard". It has to be: it was extraordinarily ambitions to write a book that deals with complexity from the smallest domain object to large scale structures. DDD is hard because software design *is* hard. Once you get used to the density of knowledge in Eric's book, you'll find it is in fact highly practical. The ideas originated in the real world, in highly complex environments, and are hardened by years of deep thinking, discussions, and experiments.  

DDD is not "done". Last Summer, during a dinner in Paris, Eric spoke about how he'd love to see more publications about Domain-Driven Design. There's no lack of interesting new ideas in this community, but they are dispersed over talks, blogs, Twitter, and mailing lists. So to celebrate DDD's 15th anniversary, we couldn't think of a better idea than to make this book. We hope it will inspire others to develop new ideas and to write.  

When we approached authors for this book, we deliberately imposed as few constraints as possible. The result is a highly diverse collection of essays. Some authors have been there since the start of Domain-Driven Design, others are fairly new to this community. Some entries were written specifically for this book, others are adaptations from older work — Martin Fowler's entry, not coincidentally, even predates DDD. The topics are eclectic as well, from philosophical meanderings to deep technical discussions, from tried and true methods to experimental ideas, from critical analysis to DDD love letters.

Eric, we present this book to you during the Domain-Driven Design Europe 2019 conference, as a token of our appreciation for your generosity in sharing your ideas. Here's to the next 15 years!

## Acknowledgments

I'd like to thank Anneke Schoonjans, Céline Dursin, and Paul Rayner, for their help with the logistics of this book. The wonderful cover design is by Nick Liefhebber. And most importantly, I'm incredibly thankful for the more than 20 authors who contributed to this book. You are all people who have in one way or another inspired me, and countless others. 


## About DDD Europe

Domain-Driven Design Europe is the world's leading DDD conference. Our mission is to expose the community to new ideas and influences from inside and outside the DDD community, and to spread DDD throughout the software industry. Please visit [dddeurope.com](https://dddeurope.com) to learn more, and we hope to welcome you as a participant soon.
