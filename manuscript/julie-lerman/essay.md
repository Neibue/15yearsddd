Discovering, honing and respecting boundaries is one of the most important facets of Domain-Driven Design. And the awareness of this practice is like a meditation that can be leveraged far beyond the efforts of building software. Dividing big, messy problems into smaller solvable problems can help one evolve towards the calmness that Eric Evans emanates. I have often said  that Eric is like a philosopher - a deep, contemplative, big-idea thinker. Those of us who have had the opportunity to see him speak or speak with him, are fortunate to witness his mind at work as it wanders into various corners of an idea.

I often use Eric's analogy of cells and membranes to describe bounded contexts. But cells are also part of all living things and DDD itself is a living thing.

In its 15th year, at ExploreDDD, Eric expressed his gratitude to the DDD community for understanding this -- adding to it and evolving DDD. And he was earnest in his request that the community continue to evolve DDD, continue it's life, the growth of new cells and as needed, the death of cells, as well. DDD was already a gift, yet this blessing to participate in his work seems to be an even greater one.

There are many great minds in the DDD community and I'm excited to see where else DDD will take us. Even more, I look forward to watching Eric take pride as he witnesses and contributes to the future of DDD. And he will surely continue to encourage the community as we spread the power of DDD.

Personally, I'm so very grateful for the support that Eric and others in the DDD community have given to me as I share the DDD story in my own way.
