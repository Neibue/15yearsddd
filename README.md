# Domain-Driven Design: The First 15 Years

We're going to collect essays about DDD in a book, and offer it to Eric Evans as a gift for the 15th anniversary of his book. 

**PLEASE KEEP THIS PROJECT SECRET FROM ERIC.** It's a surprise!

## Contents

The only real constraint is that your submission should have some link to DDD. 

It can be new material, or you can adapt an existing blog post, a paper, or an excerpt from a book you've written. It can have illustrations. It can be anywhere from 1 page to, say, about 20 pages, but we can go longer if the material justifies it. It can be about modelling, design, technical, architecture, detailed or high level, it can be personal, a case study, general advice, or a formal paper. You get the picture. 

## Editing process.

TBD. The current assumption is that a small group of us will review the submissions, and select the entries that go into the book. Ideally, the goal is not the reject, but the offer advice for improvement. All submitters are also encouraged to comment on others' essays.
