# Domain-Driven Design: The First 15 Years

We're going to collect essays about DDD in a book, and offer it to Eric Evans as a gift for the 15th anniversary of his book, during DDD Europe 2019. 

**PLEASE KEEP THIS PROJECT SECRET FROM ERIC.** It's a surprise!

A lot of details are still to be decided, but we'll work them out as we go along. Suggestions are welcome.

## Contents

The only real constraint is that your submission should have some link to DDD. 

It can be new material, or you can adapt an existing blog post, a paper, an excerpt from a book you've written, or a transcript of a talk. It can have illustrations. It can be anywhere from 1 page to, say, about 20 pages, but we can go longer if the material justifies it. It can be about modelling, design, technical, architecture, detailed or high level, it can be personal, a case study, general advice, or a formal paper. You get the picture. 

Please include the original date of the essay. For older material, it might make sense to add a short introduction for context.

## Submitting

Please submit your essay in [Leanpub-style Markdown](https://leanpub.com/help/manual#leanpub-auto-leanpub-flavoured-markdown-and-markua). Include your images in high quality, a 1 to 3 line biography, and a license. You can submit by email to contact@dddeurope.com, or commit it in Github. Don't worry too miuch about details like getting the image dimensions right, we'll take care of that.

## Editing process.

TBD. The current assumption is that a small group of us will review the submissions, and select the entries that go into the book. Ideally, the goal is not the reject, but the offer advice for improvement. All submitters are also encouraged to comment on others' essays.

## Publication

Also TBD. The current plan: 

- DDD Europe will take care of the logistics. 
- It will be print+digital. 
- It will be either for free, sponsored by DDD Europe;
- or it will be publicly for sale, and after costs are covered, the proceeds will go to charity, most likely something involving childrens' programming education. Suggestions are welcome.

## License

The author remains the owner of the copyrights. By submitting your contribution, you give DDD Europe BV a license to publish the material in this book. You can choose a different license for your work such as Creative Commons. Indicate that in the LICENSE.md file that accompanies your submission.

Thanks for taking part!
