# Distilling DDD into first principles

* My personal context, introduction and experience of DDD in my domains, my DDD journey
* Why I am not a jedi master
* Why its hard to answer the "Can I see an example of a DDD project?" questions 

## The fundamental concepts of DDD

> Domain-driven design is both a way of thinking and a set of priorities, aimed at accelerating software projects that have to deal with complicated domains. Eric Evans, Domain-Driven Design (2003)

### Distill the Problem Domain to Reveal What Is Important

### Create models to solve problems

### Apply Bounded Contexts to Isolate Models from Ambiguity and Corruption

### Understanding the Relationships between Contexts

### Employ tactical patterns to separate technical complexity from domain logic complexity in the code model

## So what? I already knew this stuff

 * Clear to see that the majority of effort lies outside of the technical realm

### Software development is about people. People are complex

 * 
 
### First Principles of DDD

* Show mind map/image of first principles.
* Brief introduction of core principles
* Goes without saying you need to be able to code

## Don’t lose track of the goal

 * Sub domains can help with focus
 * Distill the problem domain to find the goal    
 * Look for Find interesting problems 

### The Theory of Constraints

### Delivering Business Outcomes over code output

### Balance and Trade offs

 * Don’t solve all the problem
 * Master the art of saying no. This will give you more time to focus on the strategic high value initiatives 

## Be clear on how you deliver business value.

  * Core sub domain
  * Value solutions over software
  * It’s not about being a code monkey it’s about getting results
  * Helps to identify if a problem is worth solving / valuable 
  * Look for the money / how does it shift the KPI

## Show a professional passion for the problem domain

  > “I don’t have talent, so I just get up earlier.” —Henry Rollins

  * You are a professional. You are paid well.
  * Be humble
  * Be proactive, be curious 
  * Don’t just except mediocrity
 

## Reduce the cost of software by simplifying problems so that you can produce simpler solution models

> “Technology can bring benefits if, and only if, it diminishes a limitation.” —Eli Goldratt

 * Teams should be rewarded for developing simple solutions that enable business capability at a low cost/overhead
 * Modelling 
 * Simplify the problem. Change business process to make software dev easy
 * You can get to simple problem by immersing yourself in the problem domain
 * Writing software is expensive
 
 ### The Jurassic Park Principle
 
 * Just because you can doesn't mean you should
 * Curiosity and a genuine desire to learn about a problem space is vital to produce good solutions and meaningful software. In that you can produce elegant and beautiful software but if it provides no value or misses the point then it is utterly useless

## Don’t focus on requirements collaborate on viable solutions

> "It's better to be approximately right than precisely wrong." —Eli Goldratt 

 * Requirements assume someone has all the answers - this is a massive fallacy. Not about getting requirement. Remove problems with business counterparts or show art of the possible, look for oppurtunities.
 * Be accountable - Don’t delegate solution design to the business
 * It’s not someone else’s problem, it’s yours.
 * What is the definirtion of an Analyst programmer
 * If you  not making a difference then what are you doing 
 * IT more than ever is at heart of business success. IT people that understand this transforms businesses. Seat at the table
 * IT has a greater amount of power and influence than before. New busines models can be developed through leveraging technology. Teams should act like commerically and be business (domain) focused.
 * Be empowered
 * Domain experts are not system experts. Learn and discover with them
 * Look for IT + Domain experts + decision makers = solutions
 * Don’t settle for meetings without meaning and that won’t progress your understanding. Get decisions made. 

## Learn to collaborate

 * IT Team should be embedded in the business department that they are providing capability for rather than sit in a central IT org structure.
 * Easy if you have alignment in what you are doing

### Facilication in distillation

### Collaboration in managing dependencies of the system flow

  * People relationships and code relationships
  * Managing the white space / process in between
  * Complex systems will have many moving parts. No man is an island.
  * This is a team sport
  * Take personal feelings out of it and attack the problem. Be angry at the problem not the person.
  * Be humble 
  * Take personal feelings out of it and attack the problem. Be angry at the problem not the person.
  * Learn to negotiation 
  * Dependencies are everywhere learn how to work with other teams
  * Play well with others. People make systems
  * Turn head phones off and interact
  * Pick up the phone and have a conversation with internal and external people - we are ultimately on the same team - even external vendors
  * So many collaboration tools and so little collaboration happening 
  * Learn to collaborate
  * Learn to facilitate, to get the best out of people

## Understand how you fit into to the  system
  
  * Bounded contexts and context Map
  * TOC: in complex systems you are one model and part of a bigger model.
  * Understand dependencies and work with others to unblock flow for the big picture
  * How does your context/model fit in with others. How does your mode contribute to overall system and deliver value
  * Social architecture - simplify relationships. The more we remove dependencies and simplify the easier life becomes.


## Visualise the problem domain and solution models
  * explicit, clear and concise
  * Again collaborate 
  * Ubiquitous Language 
  * Visualise the model
  * Language
  * Definition  
  * Alignment - bring the whole team with you 

## To the next 15 years and the continued reinvention of DDD

* DDD is now an uncontrollable force. Even if you were to cut the head Evans, it would still continue to grow :)
* Future if DDD much more blending between developers and business people. Knowledgable IT people will turn into business decision makers
