# Distilling DDD into first principles

* My personal context, introduction and experience of DDD in my domains, my DDD journey
* Why I am not a jedi master
* Why its hard to answer the "Can I see an example of a DDD project?" questions 

## The fundamental concepts of DDD

> Domain-driven design is both a way of thinking and a set of priorities, aimed at accelerating software projects that have to deal with complicated domains. Eric Evans, Domain-Driven Design (2003)

### Distill the Problem Domain to Reveal What Is Important

### Create models to solve problems

### Apply Bounded Contexts to Isolate Models from Ambiguity and Corruption

### Understanding the Relationships between Contexts

### Employ tactical patterns to separate technical complexity from domain logic complexity in the code model

## So what? I already knew this stuff

 * Clear to see that the majority of effort lies outside of the technical realm

## Gain agreement on the problem

 > “If you do not deal directly with the core problem, don’t expect significant improvement.” —Eli Goldratt

 * Sub domains can help with focus
 * Distill the problem domain to find the goal    
 * Look for Find interesting problems 

### Be clear on how you deliver business value

  * Core sub domain
  * Value solutions over software
  * It’s not about being a code monkey it’s about getting results
  * Helps to identify if a problem is worth solving / valuable 
  * Look for the money / how does it shift the KPI

### Applying the Theory of Constraints

### Delivering Business Outcomes over code output

## Collaborate on the direction for a solution

### Show a professional passion for the problem domain

  * You are a professional. You are paid well.
  * Be humble
  * Be proactive, be curious 
  * Don’t just except mediocrity

### Don’t focus on requirements collaborate on viable solutions

### Learn to collaborate

### Learn to Facilitate


## Gain agreement that the solution solves the core problem

 > “Technology can bring benefits if, and only if, it diminishes a limitation.” —Eli Goldratt


### The Jurassic Park Principle

 > "Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they should.” Dr. Ian Malcom, Jurrasic Park

 * Avoid local optimisations at expense of improving the system
 * Don’t solve all the problem
 * Master the art of saying no. This will give you more time to focus on the strategic high value initiatives 

### Reduce the cost of software 

* Simplify problems so that you can produce simpler solution models

### Understand the Balance and Trade offs of alternative models



## Optimize for the Overall System 

 > “A company could put a top man at every position and be swallowed by a competitor with people only half as good, but who are working together.” W. Edwards Deming

 * Not the Individual Components

### Manage the solution team organisational design for autonomy 

### Identify constraints in delivering the solution 

* Simplify

### Collaboration in managing dependencies of the system flow

## Values


## To the next 15 years and the continued reinvention of DDD

* DDD is now an uncontrollable force. Even if you were to cut the head Evans, it would still continue to grow :)
* Future if DDD much more blending between developers and business people. Knowledgable IT people will turn into business decision makers
