# Distilling DDD into first principles

* My personal context, introduction and experience of DDD in my domains, my DDD journey
* Why I am not a jedi master - I only know the domains I know

## The fundamental concepts of DDD

> Domain-driven design is both a way of thinking and a set of priorities, aimed at accelerating software projects that have to deal with complicated domains. Eric Evans, Domain-Driven Design (2003)

### Distill the Problem Domain to Reveal What Is Important

 * Core domain and sub domains

### Create models to solve problems

 * Model-driven design

### Apply Bounded Contexts to Isolate Models from Ambiguity and Corruption

 * Bounded contexts 

### Understanding the Relationships between Contexts

 * Contexts Map
 * Tech relationships
 * People relationships

### Employ tactical patterns to separate technical complexity from domain logic complexity in the code model

 * Code patterns

## So what? I already knew this stuff

 * Clear to see that the majority of effort lies outside of the technical realm
 * First principles distill the non technical skills required to apply DDD
 * You still have to be good a tech!
 * Why its hard to answer the "Can I see an example of a DDD project?" questions 

## Gain agreement on the problem

 > “If you do not deal directly with the core problem, don’t expect significant improvement.” —Eli Goldratt

 * Understand the business big picture (problems, constraints, opportunities)
 * Distilling large problem into sub domains 
 * Core domain, the goal, or impediment is revealed to give focus.    
 * Look for Find interesting problems - sometimes we don't know the exact details of the problem or how to solve it. We must work with no technical people to look for oppurtunity. For example - problem is we are 10% down on budget.
 
 ### Applying the Theory of Constraints to reveal impediments to business value throughput

 * Shift focus from local optimisations to increasing the flow of the system
 * For example 2nd class shipping postage may save money but is uncompetitive and will lose sales and hit revenue line.
 * Remove impediments to producing business value

### Be clear on how you deliver business value

 * Value solutions over software. It’s not about being a code monkey it’s about getting results
 * Being clear on what business value is helps to identify if a problem is worth solving or is valuable
 * Look for the money / how does it shift the KPI
 * People don't want to buy a quarter-inch drill, they want a quarter-inch hole - no body cares how we crafted your code is unless is makes money
 * Look for the money / how does it shift the KPI / where is the bottleneck to business throughput
 * Delivering Business Outcomes over code output / Value solutions over software /  It’s not about being a code monkey it’s about getting results
 * IT more than ever is at heart of business success. IT people that understand this transforms businesses. Seat at the table
 * IT has a greater amount of power and influence than before. New business models can be developed through leveraging technology. Teams should act like commercially and be business (domain) focused.
 * Avoid software being what developers understand from the business - developers ARE the business.
 * Your job is to Remove blockers from business value throughput

## Collaborate on the direction for a solution

### Show a professional passion for the problem domain

 * You cannot being to be useful to solve a problem or look for oppurtunity if you don't really understand the domain you are working in to a sufficently deep level
 * Have passion for the problem space - this will make it easier to find solutions and more importantly opportunities
 * Focused  (Dan North) Deliberate Discovery at the constraint/bottleneck
 * You are a professional. You are paid well. You have a responsibility to understand the domain you are in.
 * You don’t need to show empathy, you need to enable your business!
 * Be proactive, be curious
 * Don’t accept mediocrity in business process
 * Programming is understanding and translating into a software specific language. The software proves our understanding.

### Collaborate on viable solutions rather than looking for requirements 

 * Requirements assume someone has all the answers - this is a massive fallacy. Not about getting requirement. Remove problems with business counterparts or show art of the possible, look for opportunities.
 * Be accountable, don't be lazy - Don’t delegate solution design to the business. It’s not someone else’s problem, it’s yours.
 * IT is the business
 * Domain experts are not system experts. Learn and discover with them. IT + Domain experts + decision makers = solutions
 * If you not making a difference then what are you doing
 * IT more than ever is at heart of business success. IT people that understand this transforms businesses. Seat at the table
 * IT has a greater amount of power and influence than before. New business models can be developed through leveraging technology. Teams should act like commercially and be business (domain) focused.
 * Be empowered
 * Domain experts are not system experts. Learn and discover with them
 * IT + Domain experts + decision makers = solutions
 * Don’t settle for meetings without meaning and that won’t progress your understanding. Get decisions made.


### Learn to Facilitate Problem exploration

 * Visualise and reveal with Process mapping or event storming big picture
 * Requires decision makers and domain experts
 * You don't need to be smartest, need to enable

## Gain agreement that the solution solves the core problem

 > “Technology can bring benefits if, and only if, it diminishes a limitation.” —Eli Goldratt


### The Jurassic Park Principle

 > "Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they should.” Dr. Ian Malcom, Jurrasic Park

 * Avoid local optimisations at expense of improving the system
of * Don’t solve all the problem
 * Master the art of saying no. This will give you more time to focus on the strategic high value initiatives 

### Reduce the cost of software 

* Simplify problems so that you can produce simpler solution models
* Don't gold plate software, good is often good enough - remember the goal.
* Nothing wrong with a hack if you excplicity understand the trade offs - story about EZY testing costs

### Explore alternative models

* Understand the Balance and Trade offs of alternative models - don't discount anything - outsource/data temps story
* Never say I know or stop at the first model

## Optimize for the Overall System 

 > “A company could put a top man at every position and be swallowed by a competitor with people only half as good, but who are working together.” W. Edwards Deming

 * Not the Individual Components

### Manage the solution team organisational design for autonomy 

  * Product Teams
  * Capability Teams
  * Ownership and accountability
  * Loosely coupled but highliy cohesive -  understanding of the business capabilities
  
### Identify constraints in delivering the solution 

* Constraints outside  IT, vendors and business colleagues

### Collaborate to solve the big picture

* Always keep a eye on the goal/bottle neck
* Context Maps important but also use process maps to understand system flow
* Ensure all teams are aligned by understanding the goal,  collaborate together on a solution and understand how they fit into the bigger picture 

## Values

* Have patience and humility
* respect others - people are good
* Avoid blaming

## To the next 15 years and the continued reinvention of DDD

* DDD is now an uncontrollable force. Even if you were to cut the head Evans, it would still continue to grow :)
* Future of DDD much more blending between developers and business people. Knowledgable IT people will turn into business decision makers
